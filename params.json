{"name":"Fluxbot","tagline":"The small, extendable IRC bot for Node.js","body":"A [Weekend of Code](http://blog.whiskers75.co.uk/weekend-of-code) project by [whiskers75](http://whiskers75.co.uk).\r\n\r\nFluxbot is a lightweight, easy to use IRC bot. It is extensible, like a supybot, and can perform all normal bot tasks easily, with a permission system to regulate who can do what.\r\n\r\nTo get running, set up a [Redis](http://redis.io) database somewhere, configure `config.json` to point to it, and run bot.js. While you're there, configure your IRC server, nick, command prefix and channels to join. Optionally, you may want to add a password for authentication to NickServ.\r\n\r\nFluxbot can be extended in the form of plugins, which can contain custom code to run on start and commands, with integrated permissions and help.\r\n\r\nWant to see a live fluxbot? Come join us on irc.freenode.net, channel #fluxbot.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
